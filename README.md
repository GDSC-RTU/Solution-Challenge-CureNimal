# Curenimal 
Curenimal is a platform created with a vision of helping animals. Be it a pet or stray, the website assists you with the simplest ways to save their lives. 

## About

Walking past an injured animal, not being able to help just 'cause you don't know how to. Never let your non-medical self stop you ever again. Curenimal is a platform that guides you through the easiest ways of dealing with such situations, and that too free of cost. With the features like 'Special Audio' and 'First-aid Steps,' you'll know how to calm your patient and give them the instant treatment they need. In case of emergencies like not having an account on the site, you can directly click on the 'emergency' button on the landing page and help them out. We understand you can't completely cure that little thing, that's where the 'hospitals near me' feature comes in. Find the nearest hospitals and give the patient the treatment they deserve. Apart from stray animals, you also get to make sure your adorable pet is doing fine. If not, get in contact with a doctor just with a click. 

The site works equally well on PCs, laptops and mobiles.
